Modern e-commerce systems allow customers to search for products, orders, and other infor-
mation using different interaction modes. A customer may enter a keyword, speak a natural-
| language query, |     | or upload | an image |     | of a product. |     |     |     |     |
| --------------- | --- | --------- | -------- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a small prototype of a multi-
| modal e-commerce |                | search         |               | system.        |            |           |        |        |     |

| The assignment   |                | connects       | four          | important      |            | topics:   |        |        |     |
| 1. software      | requirements   |                | analysis;     |                |            |           |        |        |     |
| 2. three-layer   |                | software       | architecture; |                |            |           |        |        |     |
| 3. UML           | modeling       | using          | Visual        | Paradigm;      |            |           |        |        |     |
| 4. Python        | implementation |                |               | of a search    | prototype. |           |        |        |     |
| The system       |                | should support |               | at least       | the        | following | search | modes: |     |
| • keyword/text   |                | search;        |               |                |            |           |        |        |     |
| • voice          | search         | simulated      | by            | speech-to-text |            | output;   |        |        |     |
| • image-based    |                | product        | search.       |                |            |           |        |        |     |
| The central      | design         | principle      |               | is:            |            |           |        |        |     |

The assignment does not require a production e-commerce system. The objective is to
demonstrate the relationship between system design, UML modeling, and an executable AI-
| oriented prototype. |            |                  |              |          |       |            |         |        |         |

| • “find    | Nike shoes   | under      | 100 dollars”; |              |         |        |            |     |     |
| • “show    | me products  | similar    | to            | this         | image”; |        |            |     |     |
| • “find    | my order     | 20261001”; |               |              |         |        |            |     |     |

| The Presentation |                     | Layer         | should | not directly | access      | the database. |
| For example,     |                     | the following | design | should       | be avoided: |               |
| SearchUI         | --> ProductDatabase |               |        |              |             |               |
Instead:
SearchUI
|

SearchService
|

where z , z , and z are representations used by the retrieval system.
|     | t v i |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
For the simple prototype, the representation may be a Python dictionary.

For the first prototype, students may simulate the speech-to-text component:
| voice_text | = "find black | running shoes" |     |     |     |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| query =    | {             |                |     |     |     |

| "query":   | voice_text    |                |     |     |     |
}
Students who want to extend the project may replace the simulated component with an
| actual speech-recognition |     | system. |     |     |     |

| The Search | Service |             | retrieves | candidate  |            | products.    |                   |     |     |
| For a      | text    | query,      | a simple  | prototype  |            | can use      | keyword matching. |     |     |
| For an     | image   | query,      | it        | can        | use vector | similarity.  |                   |     |     |
| The        | general | retrieval   |           | operation  | is         |              |                   |     |     |
|            |         |             |           |            | R(q)       | = TopK       | s(q,x),           |     | (5) |

After retrieval, the system may rank candidates using several signals.
For example,
|     |     |     |     | S(x|q) | =   | αS text +βS | image +γS business | .   | (6) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | ----------- | ------------------ | --- | --- |
Here:
| • S | measures |     | textual | similarity; |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | --- | ------- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
text
| • S | measures |     | visual | similarity; |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | -------- | --- | ------ | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
image
• S may consider price, stock, popularity, or other application-specific information.

For Assignment 05, students only need to implement a simple ranking mechanism.

| For | Assignment | 05, voice | recognition | may be simulated. |     |
Create:

| ------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| For the first | prototype, | students | may        | use artificial | feature vectors. |
For example:

| ------------------ | --- | ---- | ------ | --- | --- |
| product_embeddings |     | = {  |        |     |     |

| 2: np.array([0.2,  |     | 0.8, | 0.1]), |     |     |
| 3: np.array([0.1,  |     | 0.2, | 0.9]), |     |     |
| 4: np.array([0.8,  |     | 0.2, | 0.2])  |     |     |
}
| Define                   | cosine      | similarity: |     |     |     |

scores.append(
|     | (product_id, |     | score) |     |     |
| --- | ------------ | --- | ------ | --- | --- |

)

| --- | ---------- | -------- | --- |
reverse=True
)
| return | scores |     |     |

Students may later replace these artificial vectors with embeddings generated by an actual
image model.
| 15 Step | 6: Main | Program |     |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
Create:
main.py
| from data.product_repository    |                       | import | ProductRepository    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| from application.query_service  |                       |        | import QueryService  |
| from application.search_service |                       |        | import SearchService |
| from application.speech_service |                       |        | import SpeechService |
| repository                      | = ProductRepository() |        |                      |
| query_service                   | = QueryService()      |        |                      |
| search_service                  | = SearchService(      |        |                      |
repository
)
| speech_service | = SpeechService()         |             |       |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| print("===     | E-Commerce                | Search Demo | ===") |
| print("\nText  | search:")                 |             |       |
| query =        | query_service.text_query( |             |       |
| "black         | shoes"                    |             |       |
)
| results | = search_service.search_text( |     |     |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | --- | --- |
query["query"]
)
| for product, | score | in results: |     |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- | --- |
print(
product["name"],
|     | "| score =", |     |     |
| --- | ------------ | --- | --- |
score
)
| print("\nVoice | search:") |     |     |
| -------------- | --------- | --- | --- |
14

| audio = "find | running | shoes" |     |     |
| ------------- | ------- | ------ | --- | --- |
text = speech_service.transcribe(
audio
)
| query = query_service.voice_query( |     |     |     |     |
| ---------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
text
)
| results = | search_service.search_text( |     |     |     |
| --------- | --------------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
query["query"]
)
| for product, | score | in results: |     |     |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- | --- | --- |
print(
product["name"],
| "|  | score =", |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | --- | --- | --- |
score
)
| 16 Expected |     | Demonstration |     |     |
| ----------- | --- | ------------- | --- | --- |
The program should demonstrate at least two successful search modes.
For example:
| === E-Commerce | Search | Demo | === |     |
| -------------- | ------ | ---- | --- | --- |
Text search:
| Nike Running | Shoes | | score | = 2 |     |
| ------------ | ----- | ------- | --- | --- |
| Blue Sports  | Shoes | | score | = 1 |     |
Voice search:
| Nike Running   | Shoes  | | score    | = 1              |                   |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Adidas Running | Shoes  | |          | score = 1        |                   |
| Blue Sports    | Shoes  | | score    | = 1              |                   |
| The exact      | output | depends    | on the student’s | product database. |
| 17 Extension:  |        | Multimodal |                  | Search            |
Students who complete the basic prototype should implement a multimodal query.
| Suppose      | the customer | provides: |                      |     |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------- | -------------------- | --- |
| • a text     | query;       |           |                      |     |
| • an image;  |              |           |                      |     |
| • optionally | a voice      | query.    |                      |     |
| The system   | can          | combine   | the representations: |     |
15

|     |     |     |     |     | z = λ z +λ | z   | +λ z , | (8) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---------- | --- | ------ | --- |
|     |     |     |     |     | t t        | i i | v v    |     |
where
|     |     |     |     |     | λ +λ | +λ  | = 1. | (9) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
|     |     |     |     |     | t    | i v |      |     |
For example,
|               |            |         |                   |        | λ t = 0.5, | λ        | i = 0.5.  |      |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------ | ---------- | -------- | --------- | ---- |
| A combined    |            | ranking | function          | can    | be:        |          |           |      |
|               |            |         |                   | S(p|q) | = λ S      | (p|q )+λ | S (p|q ). | (10) |
|               |            |         |                   |        | t t        | t        | i i i     |      |
| This          | produces   | a       | simple multimodal |        | retrieval  | system.  |           |      |
| 18 Extension: |            |         | Order             | Search |            |          |           |      |
| The system    | should     | also    | support           | order  | search.    |          |           |      |
| A simple      | repository |         | is:               |        |            |          |           |      |

| Principle    | 1: Separate |               | UI             | from         | Business      |               | Logic  |        |      |
| The UI       | should not  | directly      | access         |              | the database. |               |        |        |      |
|              |             |               |                |              | UI            | ̸→ Database.  |        |        | (12) |
Instead:
|           |              |     |         |     | UI →   | Application | → Data.        |     | (13) |
| --------- | ------------ | --- | ------- | --- | ------ | ----------- | -------------- | --- | ---- |
| Principle | 2: Different |     | Inputs, |     | Common |             | Representation |     |      |
Voice, text, and image inputs should eventually be transformed into representations that the
| retrieval | system       | can process. |                    |           |     |     |                       |     |      |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------ | --------- | --- | --- | --------------------- | --- | ---- |
|           |              |              | {text,voice,image} |           |     | →   | query representation. |     | (14) |
| Principle | 3: Retrieval |              | and                | Ranking   |     | Are | Different             |     |      |
| Retrieval | generates    | candidate    |                    | products: |     |     |                       |     |      |
C(q).
| Ranking | orders | the | candidates: |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| ------- | ------ | --- | ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Rank(C(q)).
| Students  | should         | not | treat    | these | two       | operations      | as the same.        |            |     |
| --------- | -------------- | --- | -------- | ----- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | --- |
| Principle | 4: Start       |     | Simple   |       |           |                 |                     |            |     |
| The first | implementation |     | does     | not   | need      | a sophisticated | AI model.           |            |     |
| A valid   | progression    |     | is:      |       |           |                 |                     |            |     |
|           | Keyword        |     | Matching | →     | Embedding |                 | Search → Multimodal | Retrieval. |     |
The objective is to understand the architecture before optimizing the AI component.

The central lesson of Assignment 05 is that an AI-enabled e-commerce system is not only an
| AI model. | It         | is a complete |          | software    | system | in which:      |                 |      |
